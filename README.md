# SmartPool

SmartPool is a Python library that provides intelligent resource-aware pooling mechanisms for parallel computing. It automatically manages CPU and GPU resources to optimize performance while preventing resource exhaustion.

## Features

- **Multiple Pool Types**: ProcessPool, ThreadPool, and InterpreterPool for different use cases
- **Intuitive API Design**: Almost the same usage as `concurrent.futures` pools
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Monitors and manages CPU cores, memory, and GPU resources
- **Hardware-Aware Scheduling**: Automatically detects system resources and schedules tasks accordingly
- **PyTorch Integration**: Support for PyTorch multiprocessing with tensor sharing to avoid serialization
- **Training Hot Migration**: Automatically moves CPU training tasks to GPU when `best_device()` changes

## Installation

```bash
pip install pysmartpool
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from smartpool import ProcessPool


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a process pool that automatically manages system resources
    with ProcessPool() as pool:
        # Submit tasks with proper argument passing
        futures = [pool.submit(expensive_computation, args=(arg,)) for arg in arguments]
        
        # Get results
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
```

### Resource-Aware Task Scheduling

```python
from smartpool import ProcessPool, DataSize


# Tasks can specify their resource requirements
def memory_intensive_task(data):
    # Your computation here
    return processed_data


if __name__ == "__main__":
    with ProcessPool(use_torch=True) as pool:
        # Pool automatically schedules tasks based on available memory
        future = pool.submit(
            memory_intensive_task, 
            args=(large_dataset,),
            need_cpu_cores=2,           # Request 2 CPU cores
            need_cpu_mem=1*DataSize.GB, # Request 4GB RAM
            need_gpu_cores=1024,        # Request 1024 CUDA cores (NOT percentage)
            need_gpu_mem=1*DataSize.GB  # Request 2GB GPU memory
        )
```

### PyTorch Training Hot Migration from CPU to GPU

SmartPool automatically migrates training tasks from CPU to GPU when better devices become available:

```python
# Complete setup for training with optimizer migration
from smartpool import (
    limit_num_single_thread, 
    best_device, 
    move_optimizer_to,
    ProcessPool
)
# Critical: Call before importing torch/numpy
limit_num_single_thread()

import torch

def training_task():
    device = best_device() # <-- get best suitable device at init time
    old_device = device

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for x, y in data_loader:
            device = best_device() # <-- get best suitable device at each batch
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)

            if old_device != device:
                model.to(device) # move model to new device
                move_optimizer_to(optimizer, device) # move optimizer to new device
                old_device = device
            
            do_other_things()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    with ProcessPool(use_torch=True) as pool:
        future = pool.submit(training_task, args=(model, optimizer, data))
```

## API

### ProcessPool

Each worker run as a separate process with seperated GIL. Suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. 

```python
class ProcessPool:

    def __init__(
        self, max_workers:int=0,
        process_name_prefix:str="ProcessPool.worker:",
        mp_context:str="spawn",
        initializer:Optional[Callable[..., Any]]=None,
        initargs:Tuple[Any, ...]=(),
        initkwargs:Optional[Dict[str, Any]]=None,
        *,
        max_tasks_per_child:Optional[int]=None,
        use_torch:bool=False
    ): ...
        """
        Initializes a new ProcessPool instance.
        
        Args:
            max_workers: The maximum number of processes that can be used to
                execute the given calls. If None or not given then as many
                worker processes will be created as the machine has processors.
            mp_context: Select process start method from ['fork', 'spawn', 'forkserver']
            initializer: A callable used to initialize worker processes.
            initargs: A tuple of arguments to pass to the initializer.
            initkwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the initializer.

                can complete before it will exit and be replaced with a fresh
                worker process. The default of None means worker process will
                live as long as the executor. Requires a non-'fork' mp_context
                start method. When given, we default to using 'spawn' if no
                mp_context is supplied.
            use_torch: Whether to use PyTorch multiprocessing with tensor sharing and GPU device support.

### ThreadPool

Each worker run as a thread. Suitable for IO-intensive tasks.

    def __init__(
        self, max_workers:int=0,

### InterpreterPool (Python 3.14+)

Each worker run as a thread within a isolated interpreter with seperated GIL. Suitable for CPU-intensive tasks.  
Less overhead than ProcessPool when create/destroy workers and task switching.   
But not support for numpy/torch.

```python
class InterpreterPool:

    def __init__(
        self, max_workers:int=0,
        initializer:Optional[Callable[..., Any]]=None,
        initargs:Tuple[Any, ...]=(),
        initkwargs:Optional[Dict[str, Any]]=None,
